# Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection Model 

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The following methodology was implemented:

•	Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: The dataset was thoroughly cleaned, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data transformation techniques were applied to prepare the data for modeling.

•	Feature Engineering: Relevant features for fraud detection were identified and engineered to enhance model performance.

•	Model Selection and Training: A suitable classification algorithm was selected and trained on the prepared dataset. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

•	Model Evaluation: The model's ability to generalize to unseen data was assessed using a testing dataset.

The developed model effectively identifies fraudulent transactions and can be a valuable tool for financial institutions in mitigating financial losses.
